    <string name="_10_what_is_multithreading_i">10. What is multithreading in Java, and how can it be achieved?</string>
    <string name="encapsulation_is">Encapsulation is achieved when the object of the class maintains the private state. Other objects are not allowed to access these objects; despite that, the other objects can only access or invoke the list of public functions.</string>
    <string name="in_simple_word">In simple words, encapsulation means wrapping the data, methods into the class, i.e., into a single unit. Encapsulation automatically accepts the data hiding by making variables private and access them with the help of methods that are public. Access modifiers are used to accomplished data hiding.</string>
    <string name="encapsulation_program">class Person {\n    private int age;\n \n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n    \n    public void setAge(int age) {\n        this.age = age;\n    }\n}\n \nclass Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // create an object of Person\n        Person p1 = new Person();\n        p1.setAge(21);\n        \n        System.out.println(\"My age is \" + p1.getAge());\n    }\n}</string>
    <string name="java_is_widely">Java is a widely-used, high-level, object-oriented programming language that has played a significant role in the world of software development since its introduction in the mid-1990s. Developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems, Java was designed with the goal of providing a platform-independent, versatile, and reliable programming language for a wide range of applications. \n</string>
    <string name="some_keys">Here\'s an introduction to some key aspects of Java:\n\n 1.Platform Independence\n2. Object-Oriented\n3. Strongly Typed\n4. Multi-Threaded\n5. Rich Standard Library\n6. Security\n7. Community and Ecosystem\n8. Garbage Collection\n9. Performance\n10.Versatile Applications</string>
    <string name="in_java_variable">In Java, a variable is a named storage location that holds data or values that can be used and manipulated within a program. Variables are used to store information that a Java program can access and modify during its execution. Each variable has a name, a data type, and a value</string>
    <string name="example_of_variable">1. Numeric Types:\n byte: 8-bit integer.\nshort: 16-bit integer.\nint: 32-bit integer.\nlong: 64-bit integer.\nfloat: 32-bit floating-point.\ndouble: 64-bit floating-point.</string>
    <string name="hello_world">public class HelloWorld { \n

    <string name="booltype">\n\n 3. Boolean Type:\n boolean: Represents true or false values.</string>
    <string name="object_types">1. Object Types: \n Object: The root class for all Java classes. All classes in Java are reference types.</string>
    <string name="array_type">\n 2. Array Types:\n Arrays are reference types, and you can have arrays of primitive types or objects.</string>
    <string name="user_define_type">\n 3. User-Defined Types:\n Classes and interfaces that you define in your program.</string>
    <string name="array_def">An array is a data structure that allows you to store a collection of elements, all of the same type, under a single name. Each element in an array is identified by an index or a key, and the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are widely used in computer programming to organize and efficiently manipulate collections of data.</string>
    <string name="array_defi">\n\n In Java, an array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values of the same type under a single variable name. Arrays are useful when you need to work with a collection of elements of the same data type.</string>

    <string name="class_def">\nIn Java, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. Objects are instances of classes, and classes serve as a way to encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit. The concept of classes and objects is a fundamental building block of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java</string>
    <string name="object_def">In Java, an object is an instance of a class. It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP), where programs are designed around objects that represent real-world entities or concepts. Objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit.</string>
    <string name="string_def">In Java, the String class is used to represent sequences of characters. Strings are widely used in Java programming for working with textual data. Here are some key points about strings in Java</string>
